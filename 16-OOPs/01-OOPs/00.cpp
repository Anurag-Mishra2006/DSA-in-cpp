// OOP : Object Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects

    1. DATA ABSTRACTION  -- jo jaruri ho wahi dekhao
    2. DATA ENCAPSULATION
    3. INHERITANCE
    4. POLYMORPHISM

*/

/*
    1. ENCAPSULATION :  is the bundling of data(variables) and mehods(function) that operate on that data into a single unit called class;
                    --> Data Hiding 
                    --> Access control

    2. ABSTRACTION :  is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an objects
                    --> it allow the user to focus on what an object does , rather than how it does it
    

    3. INHERITANCE :  allow a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
                    --> This promotes the reusability of code and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes

    4. POLYMORPHISM :  allows an object to take many forms .
                    --> The two main types of polymorphism are
                            1. COMPILE-TIME polymorphism (also known as mehod overloading and operator overloading)
                            2. RUN-TIME polymorphism (also known as method overriding)
