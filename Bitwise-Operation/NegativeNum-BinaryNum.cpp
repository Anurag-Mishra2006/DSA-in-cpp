2's complement
eg -6;
first; 6-->00.......00110;
1's complement = 11.......11001
 then                   +     1
                 =11........11010
                 first digit 1--> Num is Negative
                 first digit 0-->Num is Positive
2's complement =00.........00101   
                            +1
                =00.........00110  
                it is binary num for 6
